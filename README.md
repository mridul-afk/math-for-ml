# Math for Machine Learning

A learning-in-public repository where I implement mathematical foundations of machine learning from scratch using Python + NumPy, with an intuition-first approach.

This repo focuses on understanding the math deeply and translating equations into clean, readable code—the way ML algorithms actually work under the hood.

Goals

Build strong intuition for ML-relevant mathematics

Convert mathematical definitions into working NumPy code

Create a long-term reference for ML interviews, research, and projects

Learn by explaining (and improving through feedback)
